BubblegumAgency BCN, client Projects
In this project, we have developed an E-Detailer for a client of a major pharmaceutical company in the city of Barcelona, Spain. 
It consists of 47 pages. The project has been adapted for iPad Pro 10.5 and 11, third generation devices, all of which share a navigation menu that takes us to the different sections we want to access. 
The code used in this project includes HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, CSS Frameworks such as Bootstrap 4, and jQuery.
